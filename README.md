# ShadyBunnyStudent

by Hunter and Mahad

For our shader we start with black and white and then calculate ambient, diffuse and specular lighting for pixels based on the position and normal with respect to the rotating light source using different coefficients that are passed through setUniform(). 

One kind-of wizardly thing we did for this assignment is play with blender and .obj files. In this case we exported some eggs to accompany our rather lonely bunny object.
